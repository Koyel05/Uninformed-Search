# Uninformed-Search
There are a lot of pipes in a city that are  useless  or  rarely  work.  We  want  to  find  a  route  for  water  to  traverse  from  one  side  of  the city  to  the  other  side.  There is one start node (source) and one or more end nodes (destinations) in the city.
Objective is to find a route based on the availability of the pipes in a given time using search algorithms- DFS, BFS, UCS.
